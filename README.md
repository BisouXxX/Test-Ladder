# Career at Liefery IT

The following career level descriptions are a guideline for the expectations the team members can have towards a
colleague of a given level. A team member who wants to reach the next level needs to fulfill the vast majority of
these expectations to be promoted to the next level. It is ok to have a few gaps if they are offset by coming in above
expectations in other areas. By the time a team member progresses from a level towards the next level, they should
have fulfilled all the expectations of the current level completely.

## Working students

We want to offer career progression possibilities to the team members employed
as "working students", even though their position in the contract has to stay
"working student" for legal reasons.

Working students are limited to 20 hours per week, have flexible working
schedule, and are encouraged to prioritise university responsibilities
over job responsibilities. This makes certain activities from our career ladder
not viable, namely:
- participating in our support responsibility
- taking on the role of the squad coordinator

When assessing the level of a working student, we want to exclude the points
related to the above activities. This in turn means that career progression may
be limited to a certain level, if, for example, being a squad coordinator is
a key part of the next level.

# Glossary

### Squad
We form project groups (we call them "squads") to work on a certain topic or a few features that are related to each other. The squad works for 4 sprints (4 weeks).

### Squad Coordinator
Squad Coordinator is a facilitating role that helps us organise work within a squad. Among other things a Squad Coordinator is responsible for improving communication within the squad and checking if the squad is on track.
Squad Coordinator is not a leader role. Everybody is encouraged to be a Squad Coordinator, regardless of their work experience and title.

### Team Lead
The IT department is split into a few sub-teams. Every team is managed by a team lead and the team leads report to the CTO.
Among other things a team lead is responsible for running regular 1-on-1's, helping with career progression and extra areas of expertise assigned to their team.
